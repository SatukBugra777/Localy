Ok this will get released localy, means i create everything ON MY PC first then release it on github. Ready? OK!

it got released LOCALY so how did i do that and what does this mean?
Localy means if you release it from the PC to GITHUB. 

1. first create a folder, open in in visual studio
2. 
3.once done create a file inside it in visual studio.

4. then write git init to initialize it.Git sees that it exists,then add the file you created inside the folder in visual studio.
5. 
6.create a repo after that or everything will be in vain.

7.commit a message, but before that link it with github by pasting your repo link in visual studio(git remote add origin[github repo])

8.look if it is connected by typing git remote -v

9.everything set up? alright push it (git push)
